Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
- where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
  - If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line,
and exit with the status 1
  - If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line,
and exit with the status 1
- The program should print every possible solution to the problem
  - One solution per line
  - Format: see example
  - You dont have to print the solutions in a specific order
